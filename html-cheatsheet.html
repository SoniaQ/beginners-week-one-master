    <h1>Quick Overview</h1>

    <p>
      HTML dictates the structure of a website through the use of HTML tags. These tags describe the various elements of an HTML document.
    </p>

      <br> Follow this <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">link</a> to the W3 Validator that checks your HTML code. Use the 'File Upload' option for
      content that has not yet been published online.

    <h2>DOM - Document Object Model</h2>

    <p>
      The DOM is the specified hierarchical layout of the html document i.e. skeleton (also known as <em>boiler plate</em>). It always begins with !DOCTYPE html, which tells you what version of HTML is being used
      (html5, html4...). HTML5 is the latest version, described simply as html.
    </p>

    <p>
      The HTML tag defines the route of a document and everything, except !DOCTYPE, is wrapped whithin these. <br/> Code between the HEAD tags provide information about the page and includes tags such as:
      TITLE, META, etc. For example, text within the TITLE tags will be displayed in the browser bar. <br/> Items (text, images, links, videos,
      etc) to be displayed on the webpage are enclosed within the BODY tags.
    </p>

      <h2>Headings and paragraphs (this is an h2 heading)</h2>

      <p>
        Headings are marked using heading tags such as h1. There are six levels of heading supported. The biggest is h1 (used for page titles). The smallest is h6. On most pages you probably won't see h4-6 used.
      </p>

      <p>
        Paragraphs are separated using p tags. This automatically separates them into blocks, leaving a gap in between.
      </p>

      <h2>Blank lines and void tags</h2>

      <p>
        To insert extra blank lines manually the br tag is used. It is a special type of tag (called a 'void tag'); it is a self-closing tag.
      </p>

      <br>

      <h2>Comments</h2>

      <p>
        You can write comments in your html code, which won't be displayed in the browser.
      </p>

      <!--- This is a comment. It won't show up in the page, but you will be able to see it if you view the page source (be warned!) -->

      <h2>Auto indent</h2>

      <p>
        In Atom, navigate to Edit - Lines - Auto indent.
      </p>

      <h2>Lists</h2>
      <p>
        Html has two basic types of list:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Ordered lists (&lt;ol&gt;) - displays a numbered list (1,2, 3; a, b, c; i, ii, iii; etc)</li>
        <li>Unordered lists (&lt;ul&gt;) - displays a list of bullet points</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Both have the same basic structure.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>An opening list tag</li>
        <li>Many list items (&lt;li&gt;)</li>
        <li>A closing list tag</li>
        <li>The &lt;li&gt; tags are nested between the &lt;ol&gt; or &lt;ul&gt; tags, depending on the desired list type</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Lists aren't often seen in their basic form, but they are heavily used in websites; dropdown menus are often cleverly styled lists.
      </p>

      <h2>Links</h2>
      <p>
        Links look like this: <a href="http://www.facebook.com">link to facebook</a>. The 'href' attribute, located inside the anchor (&lt;a&gt;) tags, specifies where the link points to.
      </p>

      <p>
        The href can also point to local files. For example, <a href="./html-cheatsheet.html">this</a> is a link to this page you're currently reading. Notice that the protocol and host part of the URL has been replaced by a "."
      </p>

      <h2>Images</h2>
      <p>
        Images are similar to links. The 'src' property, located within the &lt;img&gt; tag, specifies the location fo the image. Note that img tags are like br tags: they don't have a closing tag. The 'alt' property should be used to provide a description of the image in case it won't load or the user is partially sighted.
      </p>

      <p>Images can be stored on the same host ... </p>
      <img src="./duck.jpg" alt="A local image" width="200px">

      <p>... or on another server entirely.</p>
      <img src="http://jerrymahoney.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/kitten.jpg" alt="White kitten" width="200px">

      <h2>Tables</h2>
      <p>Tables are used for holding data</p>

      <table class='table'>
        <tr>
          <th>Name</th>
          <th>Profession</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Rosamund</td>
          <td>Cheese Taster</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Dave</td>
          <td>Stamp collector</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
